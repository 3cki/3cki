## Hi, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **web developer** with personal interest in automation and bots. ðŸ¤–

I have been coding since I was 11 and started by making small video games in Python, Blender and eventually Unity. During my first semesters of computer engineering in uni, I discovered my passion for web development. In 2021 I co-founded **my startup yourgix.com gmbh**. I am currently the CTO of yourgix.com gmbh and actively involved in the development of our **live streaming platform [yourgix](https://yourgix.com)** and our **video meeting software [yourping](https://yourping.com)**. 

Feel free to look around my profile, repositories and organizations. Contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eckertm00/).
